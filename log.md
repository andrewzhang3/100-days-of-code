### Day 1: May 14, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
* Worked on University Project trying to understand how to use express-validation package to do custom validations. Finally managed to get through the validation and check that it works (I hope). Just need to decide on the details now such as how long to make the minimum length of password etc.
* Read through MarkDown Guide by Github.
* Started looking through the FreeCodeCamp Curriculum and had a start at the Responsive Web Design Certification Curriculum. Was interesting to learn some small bits about HTML that I didn't realise like jumping to different parts of the page using anchor tags and # to an id. Got through a bit of the HTML curriculum as a break from University Project.
* Got stuck on making a Date picker that blocks past dates from being selected.

**Things to Remember**
* express-validator custom validations (Ones that start with body(*field*).custom(value => {) must always have a return false/true or else will have an Invalid type error (seen in postman when doing Post Request)
* Don't spend so much time on one small thing when there are more important things to work on!

**Thoughts:**
* Started this challenge in the hopes of entering a constant cycle of learning and exposing myself to more in the dev community. So far it is pretty interesting reading through other peoples challenges and progress. Hoping to plan out a proper routine and something I want to build as a project.

### Day 2: May 15, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
* Reworked university websites timepicker
* Got through some of WebDevBootcamp on jQuery (I've actually finished most of the course but I skipped some parts to get to sections I needed at the time. And now I'm going back through the parts I've skipped.

**Things to Remember**
* Include jQuery files at the bottom and in app.js make sure to include __dirname.
* Keep things organised and commented out so you don't get confused later on.
* Tempus Dominus uses startDate instead of minDate.
* Errors can occur when having two jQuery script tags in code. Make sure not to double up!

**Thoughts:**
* Got really stuck trying to work on this datetimepicker and making sure everything is correct. Finally got it working but really shouldn't stay up until 4am working on it. It was satisfying to finally get things working and understand more about what I got wrong and why it behaved the way it did!

### Day 3: May 16, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
* Made event default pictures based off type of event selected.
* Fixed CSS Styling for website.
* Finished Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5 on FreeCodeCamp.
* Split textarea input into an array to output with lines (previously newlines would not be registered).

**Things to Remember**
* Turning off autocomplete for text boxes is autocomplete:"off". Do this for dates where input type="text"!
* Split up CSS files to be more manageable.

**Thoughts:**
* Didn't do too much today, but the changes made were good. Still much to do, hopefully tomorrow I can start on something more substantial! Should sleep earlier! Also need to figure out how to manipulate MazeMap as it ignores footers and any other forms of styling.

### Day 7: May 25, 2019

**Note: Took a break from this as I had a heavy load of University projects and didn't want to include it as part of my 100DaysOfCode but the workload has come back down so I'll be back to working on some side things!**

**Today's Progress:**
* Finished Section 17 - Color Game Project in Colt Steele's WebDevBootcamp
* Made Todo List Project

**Things to Remember**
* Paper.js is a great animation/graphics library!
* Howler.js for sounds!

**Thoughts:**
* Finally finished Colt Steele's WebDevBootcamp. It's been an amazing course and Colt is an amazing instructor. I bought this course about 9 weeks ago and have been doing it throughout the semester alongside my University courses so it's great to finally be finishing it after so long. I will probably take a look at some other courses to learn some more skills before hopping into his React course as I want to use React to help my mum build a website for her rental properties in Queenstown!
